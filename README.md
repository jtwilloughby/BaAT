# BAaT: Battery-powered Arduino Alarm Technology

In this sketch, students learn the basics of Arduino-based
circuit design and coding as the build a robotic bat that squeaks
and flaps its wings as objects or people get closer to it.
The Arduino microcontroller is coupled to a standard "Arduino
Ping" circuit (which costs about $3) and the BaAT uses the 
Ping in its main loop to measure distance to objects in front of it.
